# Projects
## Works in Progress:
#### Stocks by Sector Dashboard:   [Repo Link](https://github.com/mbluck/Stocks-by-Sector-Analysis) <br>
An interactive dashboard web app built with Plotly Dash that displays real-time stock data aggregated across sectors. <br><br>

#### Housing Location Analysis: [Repo Link](https://github.com/mbluck/Housing-Location-Analysis) <br>
An analysis of the effect that a house's proximity to other locations of interest (parks, schools, etc.) has on its price. Data obtained through webscraping and geocoding API, and analyzed via regression. <br><br>

#### Marilyn Monroe: [Repo Link](https://github.com/mbluck/Shot-Marilyn) <br>
A web app built with Streamlit for a data-based interpretation of Andy Warhol's "Shot Marilyn" using the color data of the images.

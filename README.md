#### Stocks by Sector Web App
An interactive dashboard web app built with Plotly Dash that displays stock data aggregated across sectors. 
Select a sector type and view the top companies, the market weights of the industries within that sector, and the distributions for stock price, market volume, and 50 day averages of all the NASDAQ tickers within the sector.<br>
The data is updated daily. <br>

## Machine Learning
#### Predicting College Dropouts
Predicting which college students will dropout based on demographic and academic factors. Builds a logistic regression model to predict future dropouts with 87% accuracy and well-generalized fit. Allows university administration to identify at-risk students and provide targeted intervention measures. <br>
A PowerBI dashboard displays key model metrics. <br>
